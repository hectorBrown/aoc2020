# aoc2020
My solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code, all completed in Python.

Parts in one day are seperated within the file by a `#%%`, this is to allow Spyder IDE users to run each cell seperately.

Some files contain commented out visualisations, interesting results etc.

Forgive the long lines.

Also, I switched OS half way through. If certain days aren't running on your system (early ones were built on win, late with linux), try changing the `\` to a `/` in the file path (or vice versa).
